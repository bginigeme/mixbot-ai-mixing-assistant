## 🚀 **Analytics Implementation**

### **1. Built-in Streamlit Analytics**
Since you're using Streamlit Cloud, you automatically get:
- **Page views** and **unique visitors**
- **Session duration** and **geographic location**
- **Browser/device** information
- **Performance metrics**

**Access:** Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard to view these metrics.

### **2. Custom Analytics (Added to Your App)**
We've added custom tracking that logs to `user_analytics.jsonl`:

```python
# What gets tracked automatically:
- Every page view
- Every file upload (with file type and size)
- Every DAW selection
- Every genre detection
- Every analysis completion (with timing)
- Every feedback download
```

### **3. Analytics Dashboard**
Run the analytics dashboard locally:
```bash
streamlit run analytics_dashboard.py
```
